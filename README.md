# CustomerChurnAnalysis
Customer churn means when customers stop doing business with a company. For example, in telecom, churn happens when a customer discontinues their subscription and moves to another service provider.

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data and predicting whether a customer will leave or stay based on different factors like:

Demographics: Age, Gender, Marital status, State

Services: Internet type, Phone service, Streaming services

Billing and Contracts: Monthly charges, Contract type, Payment method

Customer Experience: Security, Backup, Premium support, Device protection


ðŸŽ¯ Objectives of the Project

To understand key reasons behind customer churn

To find patterns in the dataset using analytics and visualizations

To build predictive models for churn using Machine Learning

To provide actionable insights that can reduce customer churn
